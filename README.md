# Python data analysis

This repository contains a set of Python files, collected during my last assignment at a customer's site in the semiconductor industry. Specifics regarding the functional aspect cannot be disclosed.

Notwithstanding, it contains data processing modules that I implemented after collection requirements from data scientists and physicists who were responsible for the maintenance of involved machines.
