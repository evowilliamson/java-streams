## Dependencies
First of all, if you haven't noticed yet, it's a Python project, so you should get that! Most decent operating systems come shipped with it, but in case you don't have it installed on your system, go here [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure that you have at least Python version 3.4.  Then you will have to get pip, check out this [link].(https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
