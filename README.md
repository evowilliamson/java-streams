If you feel like contributing to this open-source project, this section contains some useful information to get started.

First of all, if you haven't noticed yet, it's a Python project, so you should get that! Most decent operating systems come shipped with it, but in case you don't have it installed on your system, go here [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure that you have at least Python version 3.4
